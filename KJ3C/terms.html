                <h1 style="color: #003366;">Terms &amp; Conditions for Obtaining Microbial Culture</h1>
                <p>Since its inception, KJ3C has strived to fulfill its objectives, giving utmost importance to the needs of the customers by providing quality services.</p>
                <p>KJ3C has about 180 microbial cultures, including actinomycetes, bacteria, fungi, yeasts, and plasmids in its collections. More than 80% of the microbial cultures available in KJ3C are of Indian origin and from various ecological niches of India.</p>
                <p>Over the past 2 years, KJ3C has established itself as a distinguished culture collection center for microbial resources in India. It has a database of about 100 customers who consult KJ3C for various activities related to microbiology.</p>
                <h2 style="color: #003366;">Ordering Process</h2>
                <p>Cultures can be ordered by accessing the online catalogue. Most of the cultures are supplied in freeze-dried form. Some cultures, which do not survive freeze-drying, are supplied in active form.</p>
                <p>Cultures are generally mailed by registered post within 4-7 working days after the order has reached us. The prescribed fee should be sent along with the request. Cultures are not supplied to private addresses.</p>
                <p>Cultures should be revived / subcultured as soon as they arrive. New cultures are being added to the collection regularly. If the culture of your interest is not listed in the catalogue, please enquire about its availability. A note on the reference to any publication using KJ3C strains will be highly appreciated.</p>
                <h2 style="color: #003366;">Important Notes</h2>
                <ul style="list-style: disc; padding-left: 20px; margin-top: 0;">
                    <li>The KJ3C supplies cultures for research purposes only and with its own accession numbers.</li>
                    <li>Recipients of cultures should not pass on such cultures to others with KJ3C references.</li>
                    <li>KJ3C supplies microorganisms up to Risk Group 2 only unless mentioned otherwise.</li>
                    <li>KJ3C does not supply cultures having accession numbers of other culture collections. However, subcultures derived from the original isolate (equivalent culture) are available. Equivalent cultures may not necessarily be exactly identical because genetic drift may occur.</li>
                    <li>All cultures should be handled carefully taking proper and established safety precautions.</li>
                    <li>The KJ3C is not responsible for any misuse or improper handling of its cultures.</li>
                    <li>Regarding the cultures with other culture collection numbers, search the catalogue using AHIFPC/equivalent number option and look for the strains required for your work. (AHIFPC - Also Held In Following Permanent Culture collection)</li>
                    <li>Please search the online catalogue for cultures required for your work.</li>
